# TODO Dolbear's law states the relationship between the air temperature and the rate at which crickets chirp.
#  Dolbear expressed the relationship as the following formula, which provides a way to estimate the temperature TC
#  in degrees Celsius from the number of chirps per minute, called N60:
#  TC = 10 + (N60 - 40) / 7
#  Another method is to count the number of chirps in 8 seconds, called N8, and add 5
#  (this is fairly accurate between 5 and 30Â°C):
#  TC = N8 + 5.
#  We are in August and it is very hot.
#  With the help of Jiminy Cricket, you want to estimate the air temperature while staying cool at home.
#  You then take a stopwatch, a pencil and a paper, and every 4 seconds, you note the number of chirps of Jiminy.
#  For example, if you noted the following series: 3 2 3, then Jiminy chirped 3 times in the first 4 seconds,
#  then 2 times in the next 4 seconds, and finally 3 times in the last 4 seconds.
#  In order to have a good estimate of the air temperature, you take a lot of measurements:
#  one measure every 4 seconds during M minutes.
#  Once you're done with the measurements, you can compute the estimated temperature using the correct formula!
#  INPUT
#  Line 1: an integer M for the number of minutes your measurements lasted.
#  Next M lines: series of 15 integers separated by a space, each integer representing the number of times
#  that Jiminy has chirped in 4 seconds (each line thus represents 1 minute).
#  OUTPUT
#  On the first line, you must return the average of the estimates calculated every minute using the N60 formula.
#  On the second line, if the result on the first line is between 5 and 30 (inclusive), then return the average
#  of the estimates calculated every 8 seconds using the N8 formula. If your total number of measurements is odd, then
#  ignore the very last measure because it makes the total duration of your measurements non-divisible by 8 seconds.
#  The results must be printed rounded with 1 decimal place:
